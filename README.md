This is a low functioning Reddit clone created in React.js
You have the ability to view Reddit hot posts and their comments. It's like Reddit but without your input that no one asked for (kidding!).

## Getting started:

* Clone or download this repository. Locate the config.js file in the src directory and replace the placeholders with your Reddit API credentials.
* run `npm install` and `npm start`
* run `npm test` to run unit tests on components
* Enjoy.

## Sending Feedback

I appreciate [your feedback](https://github.com/mlbaquerizo/redddit_mlbaquerizo/issues); I am still learning React.

## Technologies

This app was built with:

* React - Using the create-react-app module.
* Snoowrap - A Reddit API wrapper.
* React Router - For routing to comments page.
* Jest + Enzyme - For component testing.
